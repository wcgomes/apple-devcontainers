# Change Spec: lifecycle-runargs-host

Delta against realized contract `specs/adevcontainer/spec.md` (core). Requirements below are **ADDED** unless marked **MODIFIED**.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Lifecycle hook surface

The CLI MUST admit and honor these lifecycle properties in addition to existing `postCreateCommand`. Each property MUST accept a **string** or **argv array of strings** (same forms as core `postCreateCommand`). Omitted properties MUST be treated as no-ops. Hooks that run MUST execute via AppleContainerRuntime **exec** into the running container (not baked into the image), using the effective remote/container user and workspace folder when set.

| Property | Role |
|----------|------|
| `onCreateCommand` | Once on fresh create, before content/update and postCreate |
| `updateContentCommand` | On fresh create after `onCreateCommand` |
| `postCreateCommand` | On fresh create after `updateContentCommand` (core; kept) |
| `postStartCommand` | After the container is running on fresh create (after postCreate) and on start of a stopped container |
| `postAttachCommand` | Admitted only; not executed on `up` (see postAttach policy) |

#### Scenario: Fresh create runs full hook order
- Given a config with `onCreateCommand`, `updateContentCommand`, `postCreateCommand`, and `postStartCommand` each exiting 0
- When the user runs `up` and no container exists for the workspace
- Then the CLI runs hooks in order **onCreate → updateContent → postCreate → postStart** via exec and `up` succeeds

#### Scenario: Reuse running skips lifecycle
- Given a matching container already running
- When the user runs `up` without recreate
- Then no lifecycle hook is executed and `up` succeeds

#### Scenario: Start stopped runs postStart only
- Given a matching container that is stopped and a config with `onCreateCommand`, `updateContentCommand`, `postCreateCommand`, and `postStartCommand`
- When the user runs `up`
- Then only `postStartCommand` runs (onCreate, updateContent, and postCreate do not run) and `up` succeeds if postStart exits 0

#### Scenario: Create-path hook failure deletes container
- Given no existing container and a config whose `onCreateCommand` (or later create-path hook including first-create `postStartCommand`) exits non-zero
- When the user runs `up`
- Then `up` fails with a structured error naming the failing property and exit code, and the container MUST NOT remain for a later reuse as a healthy create

#### Scenario: Restart postStart failure does not delete container
- Given a stopped container from a prior successful create and a config whose `postStartCommand` exits non-zero
- When the user runs `up`
- Then `up` fails with a structured error for `postStartCommand` and the container still exists (MUST NOT be deleted solely due to restart postStart failure)

#### Scenario: Lifecycle command forms
- Given `postStartCommand` as a string and `onCreateCommand` as an argv array of strings
- When config is resolved
- Then both admit successfully and map to exec argv using the same shell-vs-argv rules as `postCreateCommand`

---

### Requirement: postAttachCommand policy (CLI-only)

The CLI MUST parse and admit `postAttachCommand` when present (string or argv array) so configs are not rejected solely for this property. The CLI MUST NOT execute `postAttachCommand` during `up`. On `up` paths where the property is present, the CLI MUST emit a single stderr status line indicating attach is not hooked (e.g. `postAttach skipped (no attach hook)`). Full IDE attach integration is out of scope for this change. Presence of `postAttachCommand` MUST NOT fail `up` by itself.

#### Scenario: postAttach admitted but not run on up
- Given a valid minimal image config that also sets `postAttachCommand` to a command that would exit non-zero if run
- When the user runs `up` (fresh create)
- Then `up` succeeds without executing `postAttachCommand`, and stderr includes a one-time skip status for postAttach

#### Scenario: Invalid postAttach form still fails resolve
- Given `postAttachCommand` set to a non-string, non-array value
- When config is resolved
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error naming `postAttachCommand`

---

### Requirement: runArgs allowlist and create mapping

The CLI MUST admit `runArgs` only when every entry matches the runArgs allowlist. Empty `runArgs` (`[]`) or omitted `runArgs` MUST be accepted. Allowlisted entries MUST be mapped onto Apple `container create` argv via AppleContainerRuntime / `CreateRequest` (no other module invents `container` flags).

**Allowlist (exact shapes)**

Each valued flag accepts `=VALUE` or two-token (`FLAG` + next array element) form unless noted. Two-token values MUST NOT start with `-`.

| Shape | createTokens / notes |
|-------|----------------------|
| `--init` | `--init`; at most once (duplicates MAY collapse) |
| `--cap-add=NAME` / two-token | `--cap-add`, `NAME` |
| `--cap-drop=NAME` / two-token | `--cap-drop`, `NAME` |
| `--shm-size=SIZE` / two-token | `--shm-size`, `SIZE` |
| `--dns=IP` / two-token | `--dns`, `IP` |
| `--dns-search=VAL` / two-token | `--dns-search`, `VAL` |
| `--dns-option=VAL` / two-token | `--dns-option`, `VAL` |
| `--dns-domain=VAL` / two-token | `--dns-domain`, `VAL` |
| `--no-dns` | `--no-dns` |
| `--ulimit=type=soft[:hard]` / two-token | `--ulimit`, value |
| `--tmpfs=PATH` / two-token | `--tmpfs`, path; if value contains `:`, take path before first `:` only (Docker opts stripped) |
| `--cpus=N` / `-c` / two-token | **No** createTokens; merge into `cpuLimit` (see memory/CPU merge) |
| `--memory=SIZE` / `-m` / two-token | **No** createTokens; merge into `memoryLimit` (see memory/CPU merge) |
| `--network=NAME` / two-token | `--network`, `NAME`; **named only** — reject `host`, `bridge`, `none`, empty, `container:*` (case-insensitive) |
| `--rosetta` | `--rosetta` |
| `--ssh` | `--ssh` |
| `--read-only` | `--read-only` |

**Memory/CPU merge policy**

- `CreateRequest` already may set `memoryLimit`/`cpuLimit` from `hostRequirements`.
- If runArgs also supplies memory/cpus:
  - If hostRequirements set that dimension → **hostRequirements wins** (ignore runArgs for that dimension; MAY warn once on stderr)
  - If hostRequirements not set that dimension → apply runArgs value to `memoryLimit`/`cpuLimit` (normalize memory to Apple form when parseable)
- MUST NOT emit duplicate `-m`/`-c` from both runArgs createTokens and limits — memory/cpus MUST NOT contribute createTokens.

**Do NOT allow via runArgs** (prefer first-class config properties): `-e`/`--env`, `-u`/`--user`, `-w`/`--workdir`, `-p`/`--publish`, `-v`/`--volume`, `--mount`, `--name`, `--label`/`-l`, `-i`/`-t`/`-d`, `--rm`, `--entrypoint`.

**Forever reject (still hard-error)**

- `--privileged` and `--privileged=…`
- Any `--device`, `--device=…`, or `--device` + value token form
- `--security-opt`, `--gpus`, `--ipc`, `--pid`, `--userns`, `--cgroupns`, `--hostname`, `--add-host`, `--sysctl`, `--group-add`, `--runtime` (and `=…` / two-token forms)
- Network modes `host` / `bridge` / `none` / `container:*` / empty
- Any other flag or bare token not consumed by the allowlist rules above

Errors MUST name the offending `runArgs` entry and state allowlist or forever-reject policy.

#### Scenario: Allowlisted runArgs admit and map
- Given `runArgs`: `["--init", "--cap-add=NET_ADMIN", "--cap-add", "SYS_PTRACE", "--cap-drop=MKNOD"]`
- When config is resolved and a create request is built
- Then admission succeeds and create argv includes `--init` and the corresponding `--cap-add` / `--cap-drop` forms supported by the runtime mapper

#### Scenario: Wave A+B allowlisted flags admit and map
- Given `runArgs` including `--shm-size=64m`, `--dns=8.8.8.8`, `--tmpfs=/tmp:rw`, `--network=mynet`, `--rosetta`, `--ssh`, `--read-only`
- When config is resolved and a create request is built
- Then admission succeeds; create argv includes `--shm-size`/`64m`, `--dns`/`8.8.8.8`, `--tmpfs`/`/tmp` (opts stripped), `--network`/`mynet`, `--rosetta`, `--ssh`, `--read-only`

#### Scenario: runArgs memory/cpus merge
- Given no hostRequirements and `runArgs` `["--memory=2g", "--cpus", "2"]`
- When a create request is built
- Then create argv includes `-m`/`2G` (or equivalent) and `-c`/`2`, and does not also emit `--memory`/`--cpus` tokens
- Given hostRequirements memory/cpus set and runArgs also set memory/cpus
- When a create request is built
- Then hostRequirements values win for those dimensions

#### Scenario: Empty runArgs OK
- Given `"runArgs": []`
- When config is validated
- Then validation succeeds

#### Scenario: Reject privileged
- Given `runArgs` including `--privileged`
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI fails naming `--privileged`

#### Scenario: Reject device
- Given `runArgs` including `--device=/dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun`
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI fails naming the device entry

#### Scenario: Reject network=host and Docker-only modes
- Given `runArgs` including `--network=host` (or bridge/none/container:*)
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error rejecting that network mode

#### Scenario: Reject unknown flag
- Given `runArgs` including any non-allowlisted flag (e.g. `--not-a-real-flag`)
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error naming that entry and stating it is not on the allowlist

#### Scenario: Reject dangling cap-add value
- Given `runArgs`: `["--cap-add"]` with no following name token
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error for the incomplete `--cap-add` form

---

### Requirement: hostRequirements preflight and create limits

The CLI MUST evaluate `hostRequirements` during `up` preflight (not pure-ignore) **before** create/start/reuse paths. Supported keys:

| Key | Value | Behavior |
|-----|--------|----------|
| `memory` | String with size + unit: `gb`/`g`, `mb`/`m` (case-insensitive), e.g. `"8gb"`, `"8192mb"` | If host has enough: pass **requested** value to `container create` as `-m` / `--memory` (Apple suffixes `K,M,G,T,P`; e.g. `8gb` → `8G`). If host shortfall: **fail `up`** (do not create). |
| `cpus` | Number or numeric string (positive) | If host has enough: pass **requested** value to `container create` as `-c` / `--cpus`. If host shortfall: **fail `up`**. |
| `gpu` | Any present value | **Warn** that GPU requirements are unsupported; do **not** fail `up` solely for `gpu`; no create flags for gpu |

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Absent / empty `hostRequirements` | Do **not** pass `-m`/`-c`; Apple defaults |
| memory/cpus set AND host has capacity | Pass create limits; `up` may proceed |
| memory/cpus shortfall | **Fail `up`** with structured error naming the shortfall |
| Cannot read host memory/cpus when required | **Fail `up`** (cannot verify) |
| `gpu` only | Warn unsupported; does not fail alone; no create flags |

**Parse failures:** if `hostRequirements` is present but not an object, or a supported key has an unparseable value, or an **unknown** key appears inside the object, the CLI MUST **fail** with a structured error naming the property/field.

Host measurement source is implementation-defined but MUST be deterministic enough for tests to mock (e.g. injectable host info provider). Shortfall checks run on **every** `up`; create flags apply only on the create path (existing containers already carry limits).

Config hash material MUST include `hostRequirements` memory/cpus when set (limits affect create identity).

#### Scenario: Memory below requirement fails up
- Given `hostRequirements.memory` is `"8gb"` and the host reports less than 8 GiB
- When the user runs `up`
- Then `up` fails with a structured error naming `memory` / the requirement, and no container is created

#### Scenario: CPUs below requirement fails up
- Given `hostRequirements.cpus` is `4` and the host reports fewer than 4 CPUs
- When the user runs `up`
- Then `up` fails with a structured error naming `cpus`, and no container is created

#### Scenario: Enough host applies create limits
- Given `hostRequirements.memory` is `"8gb"` and `cpus` is `4` and the host meets both
- When the user runs `up` on a fresh create path
- Then create argv includes `-m`/`8G` (or equivalent) and `-c`/`4`, and `up` succeeds

#### Scenario: Absent hostRequirements omits create limits
- Given no `hostRequirements` key
- When a create request is built
- Then create argv does not include `-m` or `-c`

#### Scenario: Unparseable memory fails
- Given `hostRequirements.memory` is `"plenty"` (or another non-size string)
- When config is resolved
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error naming `hostRequirements.memory`

#### Scenario: Unknown hostRequirements key fails
- Given `hostRequirements` includes `"storage": "100gb"`
- When config is resolved
- Then the CLI fails with a structured error naming the unknown key

#### Scenario: GPU warns unsupported
- Given `hostRequirements.gpu` is present (e.g. `"optional"`) and memory/cpus are absent or satisfied
- When the user runs `up`
- Then stderr warns that GPU host requirements are unsupported and `up` is not failed solely for `gpu`

#### Scenario: Absent hostRequirements is no-op
- Given no `hostRequirements` key
- When config is resolved
- Then no hostRequirements error or warning is required

---

### Requirement: Lifecycle / runArgs / hostRequirements fixtures

The repository MUST provide pure JSON fixtures for lifecycle, runArgs, and hostRequirements surfaces:

| Path | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `Tests/Fixtures/lifecycle-hooks.json` | `onCreateCommand`, `updateContentCommand`, `postCreateCommand`, `postStartCommand`; MAY include admitted `postAttachCommand` |
| `Tests/Fixtures/runargs-host.json` | Allowlisted `runArgs` and parseable `hostRequirements` (`memory` and/or `cpus`) |

Fixtures MUST NOT include forever-rejected props (no privileged/device, no features, no Compose). They SHOULD remain Apple-container-runnable for optional integration tests.

#### Scenario: Lifecycle / runArgs / hostRequirements fixtures admit
- Given each lifecycle / runArgs / hostRequirements fixture file
- When parsed and validated under this change's admission rules
- Then admission succeeds without unsupported-property errors

---

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Supported property surface (core + lifecycle/runArgs/host) — MODIFIED

Extends **Supported property surface (core)** in `specs/adevcontainer/spec.md`.

The CLI MUST accept and honor the core surface **plus**:

**Lifecycle + runArgs + hostRequirements**
- `onCreateCommand`, `updateContentCommand`, `postStartCommand`, `postAttachCommand` (policy per lifecycle requirements above)
- `runArgs` — allowlisted subset only; mapped on create
- `hostRequirements` — evaluated preflight (fail on capacity shortfall; map memory/cpus to create limits; fail on parse/unknown keys)

`postCreateCommand` remains required-capable as in core (optional property; when set, runs on fresh create after `updateContentCommand`).

#### Scenario: Lifecycle / runArgs / hostRequirements property set does not hard-error as unknown
- Given a config that includes only core supported keys plus lifecycle hooks, allowlisted `runArgs`, and `hostRequirements`
- When config is validated
- Then validation does not fail with unsupported-property for those keys

---

### Requirement: Unsupported property policy — MODIFIED (runArgs + hostRequirements)

Replaces the MVP bullets that treated `runArgs` allowlist as empty and `hostRequirements` as pure metadata ignore.

**Forever reject (v1) — unchanged except runArgs allowlist is non-empty**
- Feature id `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker` (any tag/version)
- Any `features` entry until Features land (see phase-ladder); docker-ood remains forever-reject after features land
- `runArgs` containing `--privileged` or `--device…`
- `runArgs` entries not on the runArgs allowlist
- Docker Compose keys / compose-file driven multi-service config

**May ignore or store as metadata (MUST NOT fail parse)**
- `customizations.vscode` (and nested extensions/settings)
- Optional `name` as today

**No longer pure-ignore**
- `hostRequirements` — MUST evaluate per **hostRequirements preflight** (not silent ignore)

**Unknown non-metadata top-level properties**
- MUST hard-error (fail closed), except keys explicitly supported in core plus lifecycle hooks, allowlisted `runArgs`, and `hostRequirements`.

#### Scenario: Allowlisted cap-add no longer errors as unknown runArgs
- Given `runArgs` including only `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` and `--init`
- When config is validated
- Then the CLI does **not** fail solely because those entries are present

#### Scenario: hostRequirements no longer silently ignored
- Given `hostRequirements` with valid `memory` below host capacity
- When the user runs `up`
- Then `up` fails with a structured hostRequirements error (observable preflight), not a silent no-op

---

### Requirement: Up lifecycle (create, start, reuse) — MODIFIED (hook matrix)

Extends **Up lifecycle (create, start, reuse)** so path selection includes the lifecycle hook matrix:

| Path | Lifecycle |
|------|-----------|
| Fresh create (missing or after recreate delete) | onCreate → updateContent → postCreate → postStart; delete container if any of these fail |
| Reuse running (matching identity, not recreate) | no hooks |
| Start stopped | postStart only; on failure fail `up`, do not delete container |
| Any path with `postAttachCommand` set | skip execute; one status line |

Create-path cleanup: if any create-path hook fails before `up` returns success, the CLI MUST delete the container before failing (extend core postCreate delete-on-fail to onCreate, updateContent, postCreate, and first-create postStart).

#### Scenario: Create then reuse still stable with hooks
- Given a successful fresh `up` with postStart configured
- When the user runs `up` again while the container is running
- Then the second run reuses without re-running onCreate/updateContent/postCreate/postStart

---

### Requirement: Capability fixtures table — MODIFIED

Extends the fixture table:

| Path | Capability |
|------|------------|
| `Tests/Fixtures/smoke.json` | image + workspace bind |
| `Tests/Fixtures/env-user.json` | env, user, workspaceFolder |
| `Tests/Fixtures/mounts-ports.json` | mounts, forwardPorts, portsAttributes |
| `Tests/Fixtures/lifecycle.json` | postCreateCommand |
| `Tests/Fixtures/lifecycle-hooks.json` | lifecycle hooks |
| `Tests/Fixtures/runargs-host.json` | runArgs + hostRequirements |

Existing core fixtures MUST remain valid under lifecycle / runArgs / hostRequirements admission.
